# How to Run
- Currently this program runs for localhost:
  - Clone the repository. (git clone website name)
  - `npm install`
  - Start the backend server:
    - `cd backend`
    - `node index.js`
  - `npm run start`
  - All set
- I was interested in a web server but I was unable to link the backend and frontend.
- Below is the link which is all done in Javascript (No C++) to check how it will run after it will get deployed:
